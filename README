This is noway version 1.0.

Noway is a start-synchronous decoder, based on a stack decoder
algorithm (described in a technical report available by ftp as 
ftp://ftp.dcs.shef.ac.uk/share/spandh/pubs/renals/cs-95-17.ps.gz).

It has been tested, and is regularly used, on Sparc, HP700 series, SGI
and PC/Linux.   Other architectures at your own risk (should work on
most un*x's).

Edit Makefile to suit your local set up.  Note that it will need
changing if you do not use the GNU version of make.  Since the
dependency files will be created first time around you may get
error messages of the form 
 Makefile:104: param.d.$ARCH: No such file or directory
when you make.  Don't worry about this. 
The code is written in C++ and works fine with g++-2.6.3 (and with 2.7.0). 

See the AbbotDemo system to see noway in action:
ftp://svr-ftp.eng.cam.ac.uk/pub/comp.speech/data/AbbotDemo.tar.gz

On my Pentium-90 linux system with 64Mb of memory a 20K decoding takes
about 5-10 realtime, with minimal search errors.  Of course this is
wildly variable depending on the acoustics, language model, etc.  The
process size (using the 1993 ARPA trigram LM for WSJ) is around 96Mb.

There have been substantial changes with this program since version 0.5. 
* Parameter files and binary bigram/trigram files  used for *
* noway-0.99c or earlier will definitely not work           *

Read the manual page (with this distribuition) and the technical
report referred to above before using the decoder.

Major changes from earlier versions are listed in the file CHANGES.
