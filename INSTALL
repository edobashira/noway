The Makefile requires the GNU version of make (for the dependency
files).

The recommended compiler is g++/gcc (also GNU).  It also works with SPARCworks 
C++.  I haven't tried any other C++ compilers.

You may want to edit Makefile to change compiler flags, default bin directory, 
etc.  

`make clean` gets rid of executable and .o files.

`make` will compile and link noway.

`make install` will install noway in $BIN (defined in Makefile).

The unix man page is noway.1
